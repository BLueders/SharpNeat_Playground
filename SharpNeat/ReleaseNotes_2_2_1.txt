Changes from previous release (2.2.0).
=====================================

Fixes
-----

 * Performance: ZigguratGaussianSampler.cs: Switched SampleTail() to use NextDoubleNonZero() instead of NextDouble(),
   to avoid attempt to compute Log(0). That wasn't a defect per se because Log() returns a NaN instead of throwing an
   exception, but it did cause a slow execution path.


 * FIX: FastAcyclicNetworkFactory.cs: Lookup of definition node index from a new/working index was wrong. The lookup
   table used worked the other way around, i.e. it mapped definition indexes to new indexes. At this time this 
   affected only the Walker 2D (Hyperneat) problem domain.
   
 * FIX: Box2dDomainView.Designer.cs: Added openGlControl.DestroyContexts() based on report of a blue screen failure 
   on one box being remedied by this (almost certainly a video driver issue).
   
 * FIX: WalkerBox2dExperimentHyperNeat.cs: Nasty bug in setting of substrate node coordinates.
 
 * FIX: FastRandom.cs: Seeds are now hashed. Without this the first random sample for nearby seeds (1,2,3, etc.) are
   very similar (have a similar bit pattern). Thanks to Francois Guibert for identifying this problem.
